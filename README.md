# RUST and WebAssembly

### What will we make?
  We will be making a basic scientific calculator online that utilizes the functionality of WebAssembly and RUST.


### Learning Stage
- Learn the basics and understand the fundamentals of WebAssembly and its purpose
- Set up a server utilizing Rust and Web Assembly and blog it

### Prototype Stage
- Blog the beginnings of our calculator app
- Have the all functions implemented in a command line type environment using RUST
- Begin the connection of WebAssembly and RUST

### Final Stage
- Transfer over all functions created in RUST to be utilized by WebAssembly.
- Have a working calculator that looks pretty :)
